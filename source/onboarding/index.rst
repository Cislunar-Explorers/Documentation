Onboarding
==========

This onboarding doc is derived from the `full-team onboarding doc <https://cornell.app.box.com/file/915225541440>`_ on Box. Feel free to add to this doc if you want!

Necessary Accounts
------------------

Create accounts for:

* `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ (Not Cornell's Enterprise GitHub)
* `VNC Viewer <https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/>`_

Provide Adam with your GitHub username so we can add you to the organization.

Coding Environment Setup
------------------------

You may use any Python-capable coding environment, but team members currently use `VS Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_, so getting help and support will be easier if you use it too.

Also, make sure `Git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_ and `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ are installed on your computer.

Next Steps
----------

* Take a look around the Cislunar `GitHub repos <https://github.com/Cislunar-Explorers>`_
